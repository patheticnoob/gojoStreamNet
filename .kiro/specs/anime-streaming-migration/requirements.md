# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Transform the existing Netflix frontend clone to create an anime streaming platform by replacing Firebase and TMDB API integration with a custom streaming API. The system will maintain the Netflix-like UI while adapting the data layer to work with anime content from the custom API. Authentication and user data tracking will be implemented later using Convex database.

## Glossary

- **Streaming_Platform**: The anime streaming web application that displays and plays anime content
- **HiAnime_API**: Primary API (https://hianime-api-jzl7.onrender.com/api/v1) that provides anime metadata, search, and subtitle data
- **Yuma_API**: Secondary API (https://yumaapi.vercel.app) that provides streaming URLs and episode data
- **Convex_Proxy**: Internal CORS proxy for handling M3U8 video streams
- **Image_Service**: Third-party image optimization service (images.weserv.nl) for anime posters
- **Netflix_UI**: The existing user interface components and layouts that mimic Netflix's design
- **Content_Catalog**: The collection of anime shows, movies, and episodes available for streaming
- **Convex_Database**: Future database system for user authentication and data tracking (not implemented in this phase)
- **Media_Player**: The video player component that streams anime content
- **Content_Metadata**: Information about anime content including titles, descriptions, genres, ratings, and thumbnails

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to browse anime content in a Netflix-like interface, so that I can easily discover and select shows to watch.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Streaming_Platform loads, THE Streaming_Platform SHALL fetch Content_Catalog from HiAnime_API home endpoint
2. THE Streaming_Platform SHALL display anime content using Netflix_UI layout components
3. WHEN a user selects a content category, THE Streaming_Platform SHALL filter Content_Catalog based on the selected category
4. THE Streaming_Platform SHALL display Content_Metadata including title, description, genre, and thumbnail for each anime
5. WHEN content fails to load, THE Streaming_Platform SHALL display appropriate error messages to the user

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to stream anime episodes and movies, so that I can watch content directly in the browser.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects anime content, THE Streaming_Platform SHALL retrieve streaming URL from Yuma_API watch endpoint
2. THE Media_Player SHALL load and play video content from the streaming URL
3. THE Media_Player SHALL support standard video controls including play, pause, seek, and volume
4. WHEN streaming fails, THE Streaming_Platform SHALL display error messages and retry options
5. THE Streaming_Platform SHALL display anime content without requiring user authentication

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see anime content organized in categories and sections, so that I can easily discover new shows and movies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Streaming_Platform SHALL fetch anime content categories from HiAnime_API home endpoint
2. THE Streaming_Platform SHALL display recently added anime content in dedicated sections
3. THE Streaming_Platform SHALL organize content by genres, popularity, and release date
4. WHEN content categories load, THE Streaming_Platform SHALL display them in Netflix_UI layout
5. THE Streaming_Platform SHALL handle empty categories gracefully with appropriate messaging

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to remove Firebase and TMDB dependencies, so that the application relies solely on the custom streaming API.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Streaming_Platform SHALL remove all Firebase SDK imports and configurations
2. THE Streaming_Platform SHALL remove all TMDB API calls and related code
3. THE Streaming_Platform SHALL replace TMDB data fetching with HiAnime_API and Yuma_API data fetching
4. THE Streaming_Platform SHALL maintain existing Netflix_UI components without breaking functionality
5. THE Streaming_Platform SHALL prepare the codebase for future Convex_Database integration without implementing it
